"No need to delay any longer than absolutely necessary. I don't know a whole lot, but you should be able to eavesdrop on some pirates at a bar. The bar on {pnt} in the {sys} system has been known to serve pirates occasionally, so stopping there would be a good course of action. We will anticipate your return. Again, this means so much to us." Before you know it, the two parents are at it again, thanking you like it's all they know how to do.
