Lore messages. These come in general and factional varieties.
General lore messages will be said by non-faction NPCs, OR by faction NPCs if
they have no factional text to say. When adding factional text, make sure to
add it to the table of the appropriate faction. Does your faction not have a
table? Then just add it. The script will find and use it if it exists. Make
sure you spell the faction name exactly the same as in faction.xml though!

One of the hardest lessons I learned as a pilot was to stop worrying so much about the damage my ship was taking in battle while piloting a large ship. These ships are too slow for dodging, not to mention so complicated that they reduce your reaction time, so you need to learn to just take the hits and focus your attention on firing back at your enemies."]]),

In a way the slow speed of the ship becomes a pretty huge relief!"]]),

Turrets are much better; they aim automatically and usually do a very good job!"]]),
