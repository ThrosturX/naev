  <description>This simple refining plant is where the ore collected on Andors is turned into a more useful form and shipped out to other worlds to be turned into whatever is needed. The entire station is heavily automated with only the bare minimum of staff manning the station. Work consists mainly in the maintenance of the droids and playing card games.</description>
