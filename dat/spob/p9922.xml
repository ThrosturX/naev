  <description>Over the course of time, the planet seems to have synchronized with the plasma storm and seems to be almost an extension of it. The planet's surface is a more or less constant flux of hot plasma that arcs to and from space. You are able to find a small outcropping to land at, which seems mainly safe from the chaotic atmospheric fury, but it is probably not best to idle here.</description>
