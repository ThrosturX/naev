# Naev Development Manual

This is the home of the Naev Development Manual that covers all topics of Naev development for whether you are intending to contribute to the main game or even develop a plug-in or stand alone total conversion. The document is intended to be compiled with LaTeX into a PDF file or other format, however, since most is written in markdown, it is also possible to view in the github browser viewer.
